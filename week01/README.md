# Week 1

This week, we'll begin by introducing the course and outlining its structure. We'll also dive into the world of computational text analysis, taking a closer look at the essential **natural language processing** techniques required to process our data effectively. Specifically, we'll provide a concise introduction to techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, n-grams, stemming, and lemmatization, all of which are fundamental to clean and prepare our data for further analysis.
